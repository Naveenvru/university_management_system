## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Option 1: Use Browser
Open these URLs in your browser:
- http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/
- http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/?limit=10
- http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/summary

### Option 2: Use PowerShell
```powershell
# Test Enrollments
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/" -Method GET | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

# Test Attendance
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/?limit=10" -Method GET | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

# Test Summary
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/summary" -Method GET | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

### Option 3: Use the Web Interface
Open: http://localhost:5000

## ðŸ“Š Watch SQL Queries in Real-Time

Check your Flask terminal where you'll see all SQL queries being executed with:
- The exact SQL query
- Parameters being used
- Query execution time
- Results returned

---

## âœ… Current Database Status

- **Users**: 9 (1 admin, 3 faculty, 5 students)
- **Departments**: 3 (CS, EE, ME)
- **Students**: 5
- **Courses**: 5
- **Enrollments**: 8
- **Attendance Records**: 80
- **Grades**: 8

---

## ðŸŽ“ Perfect for College Project Demo!

All queries use **raw SQL** (no ORM), which is exactly what you need to demonstrate:
- JOIN operations
- INSERT statements
- UPDATE with dynamic SET
- DELETE with validation
- Complex SELECT with filters
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, CASE WHEN)
- Pagination (LIMIT, OFFSET)

**Happy Testing! ðŸš€**
